# Network-Subnetting-with-VLSM-DHCP-and-OSPF-Routing
This project uses Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to efficiently allocate IP addresses to a network with three subnets. DHCP dynamically assigns IPs, and OSPF routing is configured to ensure proper packet delivery between subnets. The network address of 192.16.2.0 is divided to meet specific host requirements.
